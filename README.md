<!--
We expect CONTRIBUTING.md to look mostly identical for all bootstrap services.

If your service requires special instructions for developers, you can place
those instructions in this block. If your service isn't special, it's safe to
leave this comment here as-is.

If the text you are about to add here applies to many or all bootstrap services,
consider adding it to the bootstrap template instead.
